# My Portfolio Website 💻

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This is my **personal portfolio website**, built with **React**, sprinkled with a little Three.js magic, and powered by coffee ☕. Here you can see what I’ve built, what I’m building, and (hopefully) what I’ll build next.

## Demo 🚀

See it in action (fingers crossed it doesn’t break 😅):

**[Live Demo](https://mthobisi.com)**

## Features ✨

- **Responsive Layout** – Looks nice on everything from your phone to that massive 4K monitor.  
- **Project Showcase** – Animated cards showing my projects, with tech badges, GitHub links, and live demos.  
- **3D Fun** – Yep, there’s a spinning 3D model made with React Three Fiber (because flat is boring).  
- **Contact Section** – Send me a message without opening Gmail. Glassy, frosty, and fancy.  
- **Custom Cursor** – Because normal cursors are too mainstream. It disappears on mobile (don’t worry).  
- **Gradient Backgrounds** – Pulsing, dreamy, eye-catching colors.  
- **Scroll Animations** – Things fade in and move around when you scroll, just like magic ✨.  
- **Sticky Footer** – Because who doesn’t love a footer that sticks around?

## Technologies 🛠️

- **React** – The foundation of my universe  
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** – 3D graphics inside React  
- **Three.js** – 3D wizardry  
- **CSS / CSS Modules** – Animations, hover effects, glassmorphism, and pixel-perfect love

- **JavaScript / JSX** – Making the magic go
